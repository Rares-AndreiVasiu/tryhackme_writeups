## Hands-on exercies

### How websites work section
What term best describes the component of a web application rendered by your browser?

> *Front end* because that is what the user "sees" and is rendered by the browser.

### HTML

One of the images on the cat website is broken - fix it, and the image will reveal the hidden text answer!

> *HTMLHERO*. In order to find the message I had to repair the website, by adding the file
extension for the cat image. I supposed it still a .png file as the first picture.

```html
<img src='img/cat-1.jpg'>
<img src='img/cat-2.jpg'> <!-- added .jpg to /img/cat-2-->

```

Add a dog image to the page by adding another img tag (<img>) on line 11. The dog image location is img/dog-1.png. What is the text in the dog image?

> *DOGHERO*. I added an HTML line with the provided location for the picture 'img/dog-1.png'

```html
<img src='img/cat-1.jpg'>
<img src='img/cat-2.jpg'>
<img src='img/dog-1.png'> <!-- new entry added -->
```
