# Windows CLI Basics
> In this walkthrough I had to complete a few assignments regarding CLI usage in Windows.

## My solution
In order to find the computer name I type the following command:

```console
whoami
thmlab
```

Then to get the Win version, I simply ran systeminfo and got the response right ahead:

```console
systeminfo
...
OS Version:                10.0.17763 N/A Build 17763
...
```

In this lab i have also learned how to search for files in **Windows Command Prompt**:

```console 
dir /s filename // searches all subfolders starting from current dir
```
