# Python: Simple Demo
> In this segment I will get hands on experience with python's variables and loops.

## Hands-on exercises

### Variables section

What is the name of the function we used to display text on screen?

> *print()* is used for displaying on screen

What is the name of the function that we used to convert user input to an integer?

> *int()* converts a string to an int, if no errors are generated.

### Conditionals section

How does Python write "else if"?

> *elif* followed by a condition and colon

What will the program display if the user's input is 50?

> 50 is greater than the interval generated with random numbers, so the result is: *That number is out of range. Try again.*

### Iterations section

What type of loop does this program use?

> *while* loop until the user's input matches the target number.

What will the program display if the user makes the correct guess in 3 tries?

> I searched in the if-else tree and figured that the answer is in this very line: print("You got it in", tries, "tries!")
Since the user guessed within 3 tries, the variable tries is incremented to 3 and the final output from this line on screen
is *You got it in 3 tries!*
