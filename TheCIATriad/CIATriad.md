1. When critical services are blocked resulting in systems being down this a matter of **Availability**, due to lack of running resources for the business.
2. DOS attack is a type of attack when attacks overwhelm a system with insane amounts of requests or by vulnerability exploitation. To sum up, it is an issue for **Availability**.
3. When data is being altered without authorization it takes part of **Integrity**.
